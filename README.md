# JavaScript from the Ground Up

This repository includes the presentations and code for the MAD (Mobile App Developers) workshop series, "JavaScript from the Ground Up".
The presentations emphasize learning the language, not just the syntax, and a solid understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.

The end goal of the workshop series is to have the audience be able to **read and write JavaScript with confidence.**
